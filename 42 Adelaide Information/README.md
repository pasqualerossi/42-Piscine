# 42-Adelaide
I was part of the 1st ever piscine at 42 Adelaide between June - July of 2021 📆 </br>

What the piscine teaches you is the following:

- Vim or Visual Studio Code (depending on which one you use)
- iTerm
- GitHub
- Use an iMac well =)
- Discord
- Nuclino
- Stack Overflow 

and more below 🔻

## Skills Developed at The Piscine

### Hard-Skills 💻
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	# Shell
		The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-Skills 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
	# Self-Learning and Proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-5 member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time Management and Resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
		"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 28-day program.

and so many soft skills!

# iMac 
The biggest thing people find annoying using the iMacs on 42 Campus is the mouse itself, usually it's slow and such, to fix that do this: 


1 - Click on the Apple symbol 🍎 in the top left of the desktop 🖥️ </br>
2 - Then click on System Preferences (second one down 🔽) </br>
3 - Then click on Mouse 🖱️ </br>
4 - Change the Tracking Speed, Scroll Direction, Scrolling and Secondary Button. </br>
5 - Then click on the x ❌ in the top left corner.

# Feeling Stuck?

**Feel stuck on a question?** </br>
Do either or all of the following:

- Ask anyone and everyone and show them what's happening.
- Check the Discord by either typing your problem in the right channel or searching the whole server in the top right corner of the Discord application. 
- Google Search the specific problem.
- Check out specific sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow. 

# Best Desktop Setup
Recommend best setup you should have on your desktop when you are on 42 Campus:

- 1st FireFox Browser Window (42 Intra, Discord & Nuclino Tabs)
- 2nd Browser Window (To Research The Project & any GitHub Tabs) 
- 1st iTerm Window (To do your C Project in)
- 2nd iTerm Window (For Normintette and Compiling the C Project)

# Folder Organisation
Recommend best setup of folders and files you should have on your desktop to make everything organised and simple. 

Create a folder called `Piscine` on your Desktop

- Inside `Piscine` you create 4 `folders`

:one: A Folder Called `Shell Projects`
- Shell00
- Shell01

:two: A Folder Called `C Projects`
- C00
  - ex00
  - ex01
  - ex02
- C02
- C03 etc.

:three: A Folder Called `Rush Projects`
- Rush00
- Rush01
- Rush02

:four: A Folder called `Evaluations`
- prossiC00 (person's name or intra username along with the project you are evaluating them on).
- prossiC01


# 42 School
To increase your chance to get into the 42 School, I would recommend the following:
- Complete enough C Projects
- Pass an exam
- Do alot of evals
- Get alot of Voxtron votes

Note: Nothing is guaranteed though as the 42 Entrance to the school isn't public information.
