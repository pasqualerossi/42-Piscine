# About 42 Piscine

The 42 Piscine is a programming bootcamp, it lasts roughly 
4 weeks, working around 7 days a week, day and night. (error 404 sleep will never be found)
The bootcamp covers the basics of programming so there's no need to have any experience at
all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error
process is necessary in order to find solutions to different problems that 
once thought impossible. People learn in groups with other
students, without teachers. It can be done, and it really does work!

# 42 Piscine Schedule

This is just a recommend schedule for a 42 Pisciner to follow, you are free to follow any schedule that suits you. 

## First Week of the Piscine

Shell00, Shell01, C00. </br> 

- Learn the shell projects on Monday and Tuesday. But on Wednesday, start on the C projects (C00) as the exam itself is on the C Language and don't worry about the Shell projects anymore. </br>
- Suggest you work on the 1st Rush (Rush00) to get an idea of what a group coding project is like. 

## Week 2 of the Piscine

C00, C01 and C02. </br>

- Contine with Projects C00 and C01 this week. </br>
- Focus on the C Projects this weekend rather then the Rush project, if you missed the first Rush (Rush00), then maybe take part in this Rush project (Rush01). </br> 
- For those that ain't doing the Rush01 this weekend as you have done Rush 00, continue on with your C Projects and prepare for the Exam from Thursday. 

## Week 3 of the Piscine

- If you missed the first and second Rush projects (Rush00 & Rush01), then don't really worry about this last Rush project (Rush02). </br>
- This week continue with your C Projects and prepare for the Exam from Thursday.

## Last Week of the Piscine

C04, C05 and C06 (with possibly C07 if you want to) </br>

- This week continue with your C Projects and suggest that from Wednesday (not Thursday this week) to practice for the final exam.
- Continue to push your C Projects on the final weekend of the piscine as Sunday at 5pm, the 42 Intra closes and the Piscine is over.

NOTE: Don't stress with the exams, I failed the first 3 exams (Exam 00, Exam 01 and Exam 02) and only passed the last exam (Exam 03).
