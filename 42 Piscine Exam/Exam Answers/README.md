# EXAM

Exam Tip:

Get very familiar with the level 0 answers -  in the final exam, I can tell you in my exam we only needed to answer two questions correctly to pass - both of which were from level 0. So aim on passing and study those.

I'll probably update these as I get better at coding, so keep an eye on this repo, watch it, star it throughout your Piscine. In your final week: study these answers! They'll help a lot. Keep testing them. And remember: there's no norminette in the final exam!
